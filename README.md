### Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The exercise is to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. We also use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. We then use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
